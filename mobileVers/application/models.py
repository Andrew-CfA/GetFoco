# TODO: Andrew - Can you tell Grace if these model databases are saved in the same format on Postgre?
# I want to see if they save the time made too for reach of the models; also would like to see how the id is made 
# Within postgre
# 2/23/2021 @Grace - yes they do! When we setup the database engine to Postgre SQL when we re-migrate and whatnot, the models are
# automatically formatted in the Postgre SQL format, we need to set timezone in settings.py however! Using your old code as an
# example, IDs were automatically generated, they were created incrementally. I actually want to ask you about ID's since we're
# on the topic - should we set clients and their IDs based on when the account was created (i.e. sequentially)? Or do we want
# some kind of numbering system? Perhaps for now, for simplicities sake maybe we can just give ID's out sequentially?
