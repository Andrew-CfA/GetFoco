Notes:
Admin disable after production:
    can probably stop the admin via middleware in settings!

Functions:
    USPS (and other functions)
        think wisely about these, if you are only using it once, then chances are you only really need to apply it to the form and not have a separate function
    Use a decorator to handle client trying to go to other pages!
    wrap your account function in this XYZ 
Commenting:
    avoid writing code, unless it's a warning!
