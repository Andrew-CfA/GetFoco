# DEPRECATION

This project is being refactored and has been moved to the [`Get-Your/Get-Your`](https://github.com/Get-Your/Get-Your) repo; this repo is now read-only as of 2023-04-23. The new repo name reflects the abstraction of the `v2` project.

The project is officially live in `Get-Your` once the `main` branch has been populated and a `v2` release created. Although there won't be any changes to this repo, once `Get-Your` is live, the project is this repo is discontinued.
